            <p>Sanchez has been argued to be a toxic masculine archetype, "Tortured Genius Who Is Lonely and Doesn't Care Because Feelings Are Overrated".
                In the pilot, he was revealed to be an atheist, as he tells Summer that "there is no God". Harmon has said that "anarchist" is a close ideological descriptor of Rick.
                One of the show's creators and executive producers and voice actor Justin Roiland revealed Sanchez was pansexual. This was shown in "Auto Erotic Assimilation", when Rick connects with Unity, an ex-lover who is a collective hive mind of assimilated individuals from the planet they occupy.
